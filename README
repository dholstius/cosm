Cosm (http://www.cosm.com) is a platform, API and community focused on growing the Internet of Things. The Cosm API provides key-based read/write access to public and private datastreams from a multitude of connected devices. 

This R package provides a limited (read-only) subset of the full Cosm API. It's just enough to pull data into the R computing environment (http://www.r-project.org/), so that users can leverage a rich 3rd-party ecosystem of freely available, open-source libraries for statistical analysis and visualization.

To install the latest release from CRAN, first install R, then type:

  > install.packages('cosm')

To get the bleeding-edge development version, first install Hadley Wickham's devtools library, then install directly from GitHub:

  > install.packages('devtools')
  > install_github('cosm', username='holstius', branch='master')
