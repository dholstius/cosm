Description: Cosm (http://www.cosm.com) is a platform, API and community
    focused on growing the Internet of Things. The Cosm API provides key-based
    read/write access to public and private datastreams from a multitude of
    connected devices. This package provides a limited (read-only) subset of
    the full API. It's just enough to pull data into the R computing
    environment (http://www.r-project.org/), so that users can leverage a rich
    3rd-party ecosystem of freely available, open-source libraries for
    statistical analysis and visualization.
